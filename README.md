## Description:

This project implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python's tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows a player to play against an AI opponent that utilizes the Minimax algorithm to determine its moves.

## Features:

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game provides a user-friendly interface built using tkinter, making it easy to play the game by clicking buttons representing the Tic Tac Toe grid.
- Player vs. AI: The game allows the player to compete against an AI opponent, which employs the Minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves.
- Play Again: After the game ends, players have the option to play again with the click of a button, resetting the board and allowing for continuous gameplay.

## File Structure:

game.py: Contains the main implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, including the GUI, game logic, and Minimax algorithm.
README.md: Documentation file providing information about the project, how to run it, and any additional details.

## How to Run:
Run the following command:
```bash
python tictactoe.py
```
The game window will appear, allowing you to play against the opponent.

## Gameplay Instructions:

- Click on any empty cell in the grid to make a move.
- The game alternates between the player (X) and the AI opponent (O).
- The player's moves are represented by "X", and the AI's moves are represented by "O".
- The game ends when either the player or the AI achieves three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or when the board is full (tie).
- After the game ends, click the "Play Again" button to reset the board and start a new game.
